# Case Simulation (SEB + LST) — Code & Results

Repository: https://github.com/TracyYangLiang/LCZ-based-SEB-Simulation

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for the LCZ-based surface energy balance (SEB) simulation workflow used in our study.

How to run: 
open Run_this_code.m and execute in MATLAB.

## Repository Structure

```
.
├── Case Simulation Code/
│   ├── (MATLAB scripts/functions)
│   ├── (meteorological/model forcing inputs)
│   └── Run_this_code.m
└── Case Simulation Results/
    └── (simulation outputs generated by the code)
```

* **Case Simulation Code**: all scripts/functions and required forcing inputs.
* **Case Simulation Results**: outputs produced by running the workflow in `Case Simulation Code`.

## Requirements

* MATLAB (recommended: R2020b or later)
* Please set the working directory to `Case Simulation Code/` before running.

## Quick Start

To reproduce the simulations and generate the default outputs, simply run:

* `Run_this_code.m`

## Default Visualization Setting (12:00)

By default, the code visualizes the results at **12:00 (noon)**.

If you want to visualize a different hour, edit **line 143** in `Run_this_code.m`:

```matlab
X = A.LST_1200_final;
```

Change it to the target hour field:

```matlab
X = A.LST_XX00_final;
```

where `XX` is the hour you would like to view.

### Supported Hours

The code supports hourly visualization from **08:00 to 24:00**, including:
`LST_0800_final`, `LST_0900_final`, … , `LST_2400_final`.

## Outputs

All generated outputs are stored in:

* `Case Simulation Results/`

## Notes

* Keep the folder names unchanged unless you also update the corresponding paths inside the scripts.
* If you encounter any issues, please open a GitHub Issue with the error message and a brief description of your setup.
